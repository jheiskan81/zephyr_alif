/**
 * @fn       int pm_core_enter_deep_sleep_request_subsys_off(void)
 * @brief    Power management API which performs subsystem off operation
 *           This enters a deep sleep and indicates that it is okay for
 *           the CPU power, and hence potentially the entire subsystem's
 *           power, to be removed. Whether power actually is removed will
 *           depend on other factors - the CPU is not the only input
 *           to the decision.
 *
 *           If a wake-up source is signaled before power is removed,
 *           the function returns from its deep sleep.
 *
 *           If power is removed from the subsystem, the function does not
 *           return, and the CPU will reboot when/if the subsystem is next
 *           powered up, which could either be due to the local wakeup
 *           controller, or some other power-on request. Any wake-up sources
 *           will be indicated by a pending interrupt in the NVIC.
 *
 *           As there are many reasons the subsystem could wake, applications
 *           should be written to call this again on reboot when they find there
 *           are no wake reasons.
 *
 *           Where the system reboots from, can be controlled using the secure
 *           enclave APIs to set the initial vector table.
 *
 *           The RTSS-HE core can arrange for some or all of its TCM to be
 *           retained when the power is turned off by making calls to the
 *           secure enclave to configure the retention power.
 *
 *           The secure enclave can also arrange for various deep SoC sleep
 *           states to be entered if all subsystems have configured this, and
 *           enter sleep. So this call can lead to overall SoC sleep.
 *
 * @note     This function should be called with interrupts disabled.
 *           A cache clean operation is performed if necessary.
 * @note     This function will not return if the system goes off
 *           before a wake event. It will return if a wake event
 *           occurs before power off is possible.
 * @note     Possible EWIC wake sources are a limited selection
 *           of interrupts 0-63 - see the HWRM for details.
 *           The CPU may also reboot if power is automatically
 *           applied to the subsystem for other reasons aside from
 *           EWIC wakeup.
 *           The pending information from EWIC is transferred
 *           into the NVIC on startup, so interrupt handlers
 *           can respond to the cause as soon as they're
 *           unmasked by drivers.
 * @return   This function does not return for successful OFF,
 *           otherwise it will return -EBUSY.
